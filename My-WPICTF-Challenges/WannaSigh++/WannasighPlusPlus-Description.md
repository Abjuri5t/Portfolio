The WannaSigh devs have returned - and their new ransomware has encrypted the flag!
We first noticed that flag.txt was missing late last Friday night. One of our analysts was able to find this sample in a public malware repository, but the evolved ransware has a new way of encrypting files that we have been unable to reverse. The malware is not only more sophisticated, but it appears to be tempermental and resists analysis.

_The BTC address in the ransom note is for donations to the EFF - you will not actually get the flag if you give them $500. Also the ransomware (it feels weird writing ransomware) should only target files named "flag.txt" - but as always, be careful._
