Like the title says, this challenge IS DANGEROUS AND CONTAINS **LIVE MALWARE**.

Shoutout to the phisher who I stole this from code from. Sadly I can't give them credit because they sent the malspam from a compromised email - but it's literally his/her code. I just defanged it (a little bit - IT WILL STILL CRASH YOUR WEBBROWSER (usually, but don't test that outside of a VM)) and stuck a WPI flag in here.
